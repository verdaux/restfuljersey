# restfuljersey

## REST API provides a powerful structure for creating a REST web service in Java.

There are organizations that discourage the use of Maven due to some compliance restrictions.
In a day and age of such technological advancements, it becomes cumbersome to create a web service API by yourself if there are no resources to guide you for a Maven-less architecture of an app.

After going through a tremendous JAR hell, I have managed to put together an app that does exactly what all other REST API's do. It performs CRUD operations using a hibernate connection.

It's simple, effective and ready to use.

Following are the important points to be considered in this app:
- Compiled in Java 8
- Uses Jersey for JSON (jersey-core-1.19.1)
- Hibernate (hibernate-core-5.2.1.Final)
- Database is MS SQL Server
